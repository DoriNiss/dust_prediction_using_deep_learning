CLUSTERING PLAN

1. dust tensors: 
	a. Split to regions by x,y and average (local - copy full dust tensor). 
	b. Define 3-5 areas of dust events and their thresholds. Check for PM10 only.
	c. Label idxs by type of event (only in one region or a combination of them) and see the frequencies of occurences.

2. Meteorology: averages of 7 days sequences (X62 channels). Find the most significant signal. Find the most interesting levels.

3. Compression:
	a. Patch compression - understand each chosen channel's area of interest and patch (6 values)
	b. Test: Large areas (27X27) or bigger, maybe 3 patches per area of interest, only averages and lots of channels
